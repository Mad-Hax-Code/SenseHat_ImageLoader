# Learn Python 3 with Raspberry Pi & SenseHat: Part 2
Welcome and congratulations on deciding to learn Python!

The intent of this repository series is to teach Python in a way that is fun, exciting, and efficient. The SenseHat for the Raspberry Pi provides an excellent platform to teach and explore programming while being useful and entertaining from the very beginning! My hope is that coders of all ages and experience levels will be able to benefit from this material.

## Load Images to LED Matrix on SenseHat
There are currently 4 versions of the application in this repository. Start with the first one before moving on to the next and type all of the code yourself to improve knowledge retention!

The order of the code examples is indicated by the number following the name of the script:
* ImageLoader_1.py
* ImageLoader_2.py
* ImageLoader_3.py
* ImageLoader_4.py

## What's Next?
Done with these examples? Make sure you take time to do your own experimentation with your newfound knowledge. The next lesson is:

* Creating a Weather Station application: https://github.com/Mad-Hax-Code/SenseHat_WeatherStation
